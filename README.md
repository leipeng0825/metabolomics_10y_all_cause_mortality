# Development of Age- and Sex-Specific Metabolomics-Based Biological Ageing Clocks for 10-Year Mortality Prediction

Code files in this repository covers the main analyses:

1. Data acquisition from original database;

2. Metabolome-wide associations for all-cause mortality;

3. Metabolomic clusters associated with all-cause mortality and pathway analysis;

4. Selected metabolomic biomarkers for predicting 10-year all-cause mortality;

5. Discrimination and reclassification analyses of 10-year mortality prediction models including metabolomic biomarkers;

6. Development and testing of metabolomic ageing clocks.
