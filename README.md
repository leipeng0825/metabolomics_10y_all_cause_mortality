# Development of an age and sex specific metabolomics-based biological ageing clock for 10-year mortality prediction in older adults from two large European cohort studies

Code files in this repository covers the main analyses:

1. Data acquisition from original database;

2. Metabolome-wide associations for all-cause mortality;

3. Metabolomic clusters associated with all-cause mortality and pathway analysis;

4. Selected metabolomic biomarkers for predicting 10-year all-cause mortality;

5. Discrimination and reclassification analyses of 10-year mortality prediction models including metabolomic biomarkers;

6. Development and testing of metabolomic ageing clocks.
